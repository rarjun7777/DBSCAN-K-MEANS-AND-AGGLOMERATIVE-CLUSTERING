# DBSCAN-K-MEANS-AND-AGGLOMERATIVE-CLUSTERING

Go through the details given under (URL), related to a DataSet 'GTZAN'

>Conduct the following task on the dataset & record your observations.

>1st task: perform data cleaning, if any, in the dataset.
>
>2nd task: perform K-means Clustering for K=3,5,7 and also Fuzzy C means. Capture the Clusters generated with Both K Means & C means.
 
>3rd task: perform Bottom-up Clustering (Agglomerative clustering).  Capture the Clusters generated at a different level, and also prepare dendrograms.

>4rth task: perform density-based (DBSCAN) Clustering

>5th Task: prepare a brief Comparative summary of clusters generated using the above clustering techniques.
